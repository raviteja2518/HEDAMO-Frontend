Hedamo is a frontend demonstration of a product disclosure system designed to present producer-declared information in a clear, structured, and transparent manner without implying verification, certification, or endorsement. The system enables users to explore products through search, filtering, sorting, and side-by-side comparison while clearly indicating that all information shown is provided by producers and displayed as-is. Product detail views present disclosure metadata such as “Declared by,” “Declared on,” evidence count, version history, and workflow status (Draft, Submitted, Published), where each status represents a disclosure stage rather than a quality judgment or approval. The interface deliberately avoids authority language and instead emphasizes neutral, precise communication to help users understand what information is available and what the system does not do. Hedamo does not validate accuracy, guarantee completeness, rank products, or make recommendations; responsibility for interpretation remains with the user. The project focuses on frontend craftsmanship, interaction design, and honest communication design, demonstrating how a disclosure-first system can support informed decision-making while maintaining clear boundaries around verification and institutional authority.
